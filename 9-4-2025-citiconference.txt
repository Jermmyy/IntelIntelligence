when will 14A work or not?

somewhere in 26.


Separation foundry and products?

Seperate p&l's
More targeted performance per segment, management focus on different margins and results






Some of us expected new customers?

Rly confident with how things are going.
PL first SKU end of year and into next year ramp.
Still opportunity for 18A and still multiple ways
CFO Zisner knows there will be a customer
Early stages of PDK maturity
18A still end of year with rest first half of 2025

Competitive dynamics on cpu's compared to amd i think?

18A will give great opportunity
Performance stablizized
Some work to do on client side portfolio
Another wave of arrow lake

Nova lake will address the desktop market and they should be in a pretty good place.


Datacenter side:
CWF on 18A, DIAMOND RAPIDS ON 18A.
Work to do on pure design side to be really competitive
in certain markets we are really competitive,
dont check all the boxes still need some work
Lip bu wants the portfolio in the right place by spending  time with customers and translating that into the roadmap.
