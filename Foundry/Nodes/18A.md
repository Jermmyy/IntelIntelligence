### Abstract
- RibbonFET gate-all-around
- PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN)
- Provides over 30% density scaling and a full node of performance improvement compared to intel 3
- 18A achieved 18%/25% performance (0.75V/1.1V) at iso-power over intel 3 through industry-first combination and optimization of advanced interconnects, a Gate-All-ARound (GAA) transistor architecture, backside power (BSPDN), and design co-optimization.
- 18A offers high-performance (HP) and high-density (HD) libraries with full-featured technology design capabilities and enhanced design ease of use.
### Introduction
- Backside power provides performance and density scaling in addition to reducing the need to scale interconnect pitch which reduces the cost of frontside metals.
- 18A consists of a HP 180nm cell height (180CH) library and an HD 160nm cell heigh (160CH) library targeted for lower power applications
- Performance improvements are achieved by the combination and optimization of three key vectors:
	- Transistor
		- **RibbonFET** transistors provide higher transistor drives, improved gate control and leakage, lower capacitance, and improved transistor optimization through ribbon width options.
	- Interconnect
	- Backside Power
		- Significantly reduces power droop and the need for signal interconnect scaling by eliminating the power grid on the front side metal layers improving interconnect performance, routing efficiency including 8-10% density improvement through higher utilization and design ease of use.
- 18A uses fewer signal routing metal layers vs intel 3 and avoids expensive pitch scaling due to backside power and it is fully compatible with Foveros and EMIB advanced packaging process for optimized product disaggregation strategies.



##### Cell libraries
Standard cell library comparison of intel 3 versus intel 18A. Library scaling heigh achieved by replacing fins with a single ribbon driving the cell size reduction. PowerVia enables power connection at cell boundary.

##### Area scaling, Power Droop and Power Efficiency
Intel 18A vs Intel 3
- High performance block frequency increases by 18%/25% performance and power decreases by 38%/36% at 0.75V/1.1V
- High density block scaling is 0.72x with 8-10% benefit in standard cell utilization.
- Heat maps of industry standard CPU showing 10x worst case IR droop reduction on intel 18A vs Intel 3 due to back side power (bump to transistor)
- ***As we see here Voltage droop is mostly less then 5mv with some under 10mv***
